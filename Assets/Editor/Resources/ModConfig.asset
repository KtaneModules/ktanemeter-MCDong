  description: "[h1]On the subject of Meter[/h1]\n\n\"A poet can survive anything
    but a misprint\" -Oscar Wilde\r\n\nThink you're a prosody pro, and a master of
    metrical\nfeet? Are you able to figure out Homer and Keats? Do you\nknow how a
    dactyl compares to an anapest? Know how to\nhandle some macrons and breves? Can
    you measure the rhythm and\nbeats? Or will syllables make you explode in defeat?\n\n-\nWritten
